Search and show API endpoint information:

Given a search term like "$ARGUMENTS", find all related API endpoints in server/server.js:

1. Search for routes matching the term (e.g., "tribe", "attack", "build")
2. Show the HTTP method (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
3. Show the route path
4. Show what the endpoint does (from comments or code analysis)
5. Show required parameters

Format output as a table.
